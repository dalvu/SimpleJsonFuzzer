# Simple Json Fuzzer - Python

v0.0.1:

- simple script that takes in a json file from your localmachine
- returns a valid random negative data type value json each time the script is called  
- the script does not change the json schema structure (yet), it only switches your json values to their negative data type values (keys stay intact)
- run script "python3 main.py <your json file>"
##### More features to come ... (hopefully)
